Thutmose III\'s greatness is defined by military genius and empire administration. Ramses II\'s greatness stems from his longevity, monumental legacy, and diplomatic acumen. Each ruler excelled in the context of their time, addressing different challenges and opportunities, and all three left indelible marks on Egyptian history. Their combined reigns represent a golden age, showcasing the diverse ways pharaonic power could be wielded effectively.',

CT scans of his mummy reveal he suffered from physical ailments, including a club foot and likely bone disease (Köhler disease II), necessitating the use of numerous walking canes found in his tomb.

Pharaoh Sneferu (Khufu\'s father) experimented further, building the collapsed pyramid at Meidum, the unique Bent Pyramid at Dahshur, and finally the first successful true, smooth-sided pyramid, the Red Pyramid, setting the stage for Giza.',

Higher quality Tura limestone for the smooth outer casing was quarried across the Nile and ferried over. Massive granite blocks for the internal chambers and sarcophagus came from Aswan, over 800km south. Quarrying likely involved pounding channels with hard dolerite balls, inserting wooden wedges that were soaked to expand and split the rock, and using copper or bronze chisels and saws (possibly aided by abrasive sand) for shaping.',

Heavy blocks from Tura and Aswan were likely transported down the Nile on large wooden barges. Moving blocks overland probably involved hauling them on large wooden sledges. Evidence, including a famous tomb painting from el-Bersheh, suggests workers dragged these sledges over specially prepared surfaces, possibly lubricated by wetting the sand in front of the sledge to reduce friction. Complex systems of ropes, levers, and immense manpower were essential. Claims of alien technology or levitation lack any evidence.',

It\'s also possible a combination of methods was used, perhaps an external ramp for lower levels and an internal one for higher levels.

While practical for administration, it slowly drifted against the seasons. They also used lunar calendars for religious festivals. For measuring time during the day, they used sun clocks (shadow clocks or gnomons, related to obelisks). For nighttime or cloudy days, they invented the water clock (*clepsydra*), a vessel from which water dripped at a constant rate, with markings indicating the hours.',
